- Open build.gradle (belongs to App, not the Main project one)
- Find the line *//testCoverageEnabled=true* and uncomment it.
- In Android Studio, sync your gradle configuration with your project ( from the toolbar)
- Open the **Gradle Tasks** perspective (on the right hand side of the screen in Android Studio) double click on **verification** > **createMockDebugCoverageReport**
- Once the task is complete, you can find the coverage report in app/build/reports/coverage/mock/debug
- Open the **index.html** file in web browser.
